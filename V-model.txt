Advantages of V-model:

1.Easy and simple to use.
2.Testing activities like test designing , planinng all happens before coding . this saves allot of time thats why it has a higher chance of success over the waterfall model
3.Proactive defect tracking â€“ that is defects are found at early stage.
4.Avoids the downward flow of the defects.
5.Works better for smaller projects where requirements are easily understood

Disadvantages of V-model:

1.Very hard and least flexible.
2.Software is developed during the implementation phase, so no early prototypes of the software are produced.
3.If any changes happen in the middle of the test , then the test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated.
